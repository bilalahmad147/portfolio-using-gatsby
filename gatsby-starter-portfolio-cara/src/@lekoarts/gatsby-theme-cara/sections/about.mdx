## About

I have 5+ years of experience as a software engineer, entrepreneur, and team builder.
I founded and sold two startups (BillMonk, Precision Polling), and built a new 8-figure ARR business at SurveyMonkey (Audience).

I'm a hands-on technical leader who has built software products from the ground up, run large engineering teams, and provided guidance at the executive and board level.
I'm motivated by product success and business growth, not technology for technology's sake.

I'm always interested in becoming a better technology leader, and meeting interesting people in NYC.
